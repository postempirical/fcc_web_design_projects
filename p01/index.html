          Nelson Mandela , in full Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, byname Madiba,
          (born July 18, 1918, Mvezo, South Africa—died December 5, 2013,
          Johannesburg), Black nationalist and the first Black president of
          South Africa (1994–99). His negotiations in the early 1990s with South
          African Pres. F.W. de Klerk helped end the country’s apartheid system
          of racial segregation and ushered in a peaceful transition to majority

          Nelson Mandela became an important figure in the ANC, helping set up
          and lead a section for young people called the ANC Youth League. He
          later travelled the country to gain support for non-violent protests
          against the National Party’s racists laws. But his activism made him
          very unpopular with the authorities, and in 1956 he was arrested for
          treason, the crime of betraying your country’s government. Held in
          Johannesburg Prison, it would be five years until the charges were
          dropped and Nelson was released.

          infection, Nelson Mandela sadly died in December 2013, he was 95 years
          old.
